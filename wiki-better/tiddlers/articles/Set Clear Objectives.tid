Is your goal to maintain a 90% average in your classes? If that's the case, what exactly do you need to do to achieve that? How long do you have to study? What books do you have to read? What other activities or opportunities do you have to sacrifice (there is always a sacrifice)? Your goals and how you pursue them will always determine your outcome. Never rely on luck or chance. You control your future.
