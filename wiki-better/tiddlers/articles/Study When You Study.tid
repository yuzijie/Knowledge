title: Study When You Study

The most important tip I have when it comes to studying is to not multi-task. You may think that Facebook, Youtube, TV, video games and internet surfing only have a slight impact on your studying, but we both know that's not true. Something as simple as turning your TV off can improve your productivity by 500%. Seriously. When you study, study. That's it.
