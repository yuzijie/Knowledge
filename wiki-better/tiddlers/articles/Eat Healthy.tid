title: Eat Healthy
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Start the day with a good breakfast. Stay away from junk food. Drink lots of water. Eat vegetables and fruit. These tips are suggested so often they may seem cliche, but they can't be stressed enough. Like exercise, what you eat has a huge impact on your cognitive abilities. Your brain really does function better when it's on a healthy vegetable and fruit filled diet. I know it's tough to eat healthy sometimes, but just start with small steps. I recommend eating an apple every day in the morning. Apples are cheap, healthy, taste good and are known to wake you up like coffee.
