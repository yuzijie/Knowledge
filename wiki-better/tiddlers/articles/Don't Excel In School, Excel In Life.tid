title: Don't Excel In School, Excel In Life
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

School is meant to prepare you for your adult, working life. But it doesn't resemble an adult's working life. There are no exams, there are no teachers, there are no grades, there is no homework. Instead, there are interpersonal relationships, practical knowledge and experience, real-life consequences for mistakes, and self-lead experiments and projects. Many students that graduate with stellar grades end up performing horribly in their professional lives because they lack the more important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, critical thinking and time management. In layman's terms, they are book smart, not street smart. But to be truly successful, you need both.
