title: Make Studying Fun
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Study with a friend, act things out, draw out diagrams, get your friends to quiz you, make bets with your friends on who can get the better grade, study outside in a park or make your studying into a game. Those who enjoy studying more always do better than those who don't. Even if the content isn't fun, you can always find ways to make the process more fun.
