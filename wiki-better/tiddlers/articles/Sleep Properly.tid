title: Sleep Properly
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Humans are not designed to sleep on irregular schedules. Before the invention of the light bulb, we always slept around the same time when it got dark and woke up around the same time when it was bright. I guarantee you that if you manage to sleep at the same time every day for one week, you will feel noticeably more alert, energetic and smart. One big reason why you feel more energetic in the summer is because the additional sunlight helps to regulate your sleep.
