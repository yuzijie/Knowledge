Figures refer to incentives applied at national level through corporate income taxes, employer social security contributions and withholding taxes for R&D personnel. Personal and consumption tax incentives are not included. While typically non-discretionary, some countries require pre-approval of R&D projects or @@.nolink [[accreditation]]@@<<dict "accreditation" "77">> by government agencies or third parties.
