<span class="green">Lokshin and Mohnen (2010)</span> review the credit as it exists in the Netherlands, covering a period from 1996-2004 estimating the elasticity of firm R&D capital accumulation to its user cost. The authors use this as an input to a cost benefit analysis which is based around the idea that a firm’s response is dynamic over time encountering delays such as project proposal and financing. As such the impacts of the scheme are measured throughout time. Included in these impacts are the compliance costs for companies as well as the government’s opportunity costs for the tax expenditure itself which are often excluded from credit evaluations.

Their findings conclude that there is additionality in the scheme but that crowding out can only be rejected for smaller firms. This is reflective of a situation where smaller firms may not have the same access to finance as large firms with internal financing functions and greater capacity to supply collateral. The authors also find that in the short-term the scheme is effective however the long-term the impacts of the scheme fall due to the level based nature of the incentive.
