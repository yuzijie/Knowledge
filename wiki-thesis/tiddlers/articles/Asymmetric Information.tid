title: Asymmetric Information
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Another market failure is the presence of asymmetric information. Market transactions that would normally take place often break down when <span class="yellow">the seller knows more about a product than the buyer</span>. If the quality of a product is undistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain.

The presence of <span class="yellow">asymmetric information between R&D performers and financiers limits financing of R&D projects</span>. A research based project warrants ''secrecy'' to prevent rivals from undertaking similar work but project financing ''requires'' release of vital information to determine the quality of the research. In the absence of perfect information, many projects lapse due to lack of financing (Hall, 2002). This is clearly a more acute problem in smaller firms with poorer access to debt or equity than research divisions of large multi-nationals. This phenomenon may not be observable as discouraged firms may not choose to apply for finance at all.
