R&D entities with an aggregated turnover of less than AUD 20 million per annum, provided they are not controlled by income tax exempt entities, are eligible for the refundable tax offset.|

You are an R&D entity if you are a corporation that is any of the following: (i) incorporated under an Australian law, (ii) incorporated under a foreign law but an Australian resident for income purposes, (iii) incorporated under a foreign law and you are both a) a resident of a country with which Australia has a double tax agreement, including a definition of 'permanent establishment'; and b) carrying on business in Australia through a permanent establishment as defined in the double tax agreement. You are not eligible for an R&D tax offset if you are: (i) an individual, (ii) a corporate limited partnership, (iii) an exempt entity (where your entire income ï¿¼is exempt from income tax).|

|Pre-approval / documentation|Only an R&D entity can claim a research and development (R&D) tax offset for eligible R&D activities carried out in an income year. Activities can be physically performed outside Australia and remain eligible for benefits only if approved by the government before or during the year the project was commenced. Approval will be granted if the Australian core activities could not be completed without them, and the activities are unable to be conducted in Australia for defined reasons, including: (i) no access to facilities or expertise in Australia, (ii) require access to population of living objects not available in Australia, or (iii) require access to geographical or geological features not available in Australia. At least 50% of total costs of the project across all project years must be incurred in Australia. Taxpayers must file the Application for Registration of R&D Activities with ''~AusIndustry'' (A division within the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education) within 10 months of the tax year end (even if an advance finding has been obtained). The R&D tax credits are then claimed on the taxpayer's annual company income tax return.|
