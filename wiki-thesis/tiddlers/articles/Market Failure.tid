<span class="yellow">While the preceding section demonstrates the importance of R&D for economic growth, this does not automatically imply that the State should intervene to encourage R&D investment.</span> Economists usually require the existence of a <span class="yellow">market failure</span>, for instance underinvestment by the private sector relative to a societal optimum level, as a necessary condition for intervention. There is a significant body of literature describing the market failures which exist around firm investment in R&D and this is discussed below.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
