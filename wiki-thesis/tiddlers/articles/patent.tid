<span class="yellow">One of the ways in which companies are incentivised to invest in R&D is by the granting of patents</span>. Patents are designed to give the firm temporary monopoly power over their economic benefits from the research which increases the appropriability of the returns of R&D to the firm. This minimises the gap between social and private returns and serves to increase private R&D to a level closer to the social optimum. However, patents are <span class="blue">not without their own criticisms</span>. For example, Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980) showed that in the presence of patents, firms would undertake socially excessive R&D expenditures in their attempts to deter entry to market with patented inventions.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
