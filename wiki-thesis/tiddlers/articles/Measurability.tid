title: Measurability
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There are several ways to measure the value of R&D tax provisions. Tax expenditures are deviations from a benchmark tax system (OECD, 2010) and countries use different national benchmarks. The 2013 OECD questionnaire adopted a common reference framework based on full deductibility of current R&D expenditures and a country's baseline treatment of capital investments. Available estimates are typically in terms of initial revenue loss, with no or minimal adjustments for behaviour effects. Some only report claims realised in a given year, while others report losses to government on an accrual basis, excluding claims referring to earlier periods and including claims for current R&D to be used in the future.

The B-index traditionally assumes that the "representative firm" is taxable and enjoys the incentive's full benefit. An adjusted B-index is reported for a firm unable to claim tax benefits in the reporting period. When credits or allowances are fully refundable, the B-index of a company in such position is identical to the profit scenario. Carry-forwards are modelled as discounted options to claim the incentive in the future, assuming a constant annual probability of returning to profit of 50% and a nominal discount rate of 10%.
