title: Ability of Government to Correct the Market Failure
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The existence of a gap between the private and social returns to R&D as outlined previously is not sufficient in itself to justify a government support such as a tax credit. It is critical that R&D Tax Credits <span class="yellow">induce</span> firms to increase expenditure on R&D rather than merely use them to <span class="yellow">replace</span> expenditure they would have otherwise committed to R&D. Where an R&D credit replaces existing expenditure it imposes a deadweight loss on society. In addition, there are <span class="yellow">unintended consequences</span> associated with government incentives for R&D which are supported by empirical research.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
