New estimates of the cost of R&D tax incentives have been combined with data on direct R&D funding (R&D grants and purchases), as reported by firms, to provide a more complete picture of government efforts to promote business R&D. Across countries, R&D intensity in the business sector is significantly correlated with total government support for business R&D. This does not imply a causal relationship and there are notable exceptions. Germany and Korea have relatively high business R&D intensity compared to their degree of government support, while Canada, the Russian Federation and Turkey have high rates of support relative to countries with similar //R&D to GDP ratios//. In 2011, Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland did not offer tax incentives but had very R&D-intensive business sectors. In 2013, Finland introduced an R&D tax allowance for the first time.
