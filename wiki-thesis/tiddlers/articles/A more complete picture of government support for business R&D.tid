In addition to providing grants, contracts and loans, many governments contribute to business R&D through tax incentives. In 2013, 27 OECD countries gave preferential tax treatment to business R&D expenditures. In 2011, the Russian Federation, Korea, France and Slovenia provided the most combined support for business R&D as a percentage of GDP. R&D tax credits were worth USD 8.3 billion in the United States, followed by France and China.
