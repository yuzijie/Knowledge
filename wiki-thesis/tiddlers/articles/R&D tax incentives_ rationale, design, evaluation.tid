Governments can choose among various tools to leverage business research and development (R&D). They can offer direct support via grants or procurement or they can use fiscal incentives, such as R&D tax incentives. More countries are now using tax incentives than a decade ago and the schemes are more generous than ever. As of today more than 20 OECD governments provide fiscal incentives to sustain business R&D, up from 12 in 1995 and 18 in 2004. Of the countries that do not have R&D tax incentives, Germany and Finland are currently discussing their introduction. This note sets out key considerations for the rationale, design and evaluation of such measures.
