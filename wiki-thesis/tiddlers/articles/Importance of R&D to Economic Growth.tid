title: Importance of R&D to Economic Growth
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Research and Development (R&D) activities tend to be publicly welcomed due to the perceived tax revenues, highly paid jobs, and trickle down effects for the local areas associated with large R&D investments. However, economists tend to view the benefits of R&D in terms of their contribution to productivity and thus to economic growth. This chapter describes the mechanisms by which R&D drives economic growth.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
