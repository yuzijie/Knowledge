title: National differences in the cost of R&D tax incentives
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

National differences in the cost of R&D tax incentives reflect eligibility rules and their use by firms, which depends not only on ''R&D spending'' but also on ''profitability''. Effective tax subsidy rates are influenced by business characteristics. Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal give more generous treatment to SMEs relative to large firms. Some countries allow firms to benefit from tax incentives when they are not profitable enough to use them in the current period, but few do so to a significant extend In Austria and Norway, refunds by authorities effectively allow such firms to benefit from incentives as if they were profitable. Refunds and carry-forward provisions are sometimes used to promote R&D in firms that could not otherwise use their credits or allowances. Such provisions tend to be more generous for SMEs and younger firms, as in Australia, France and the United Kingdom.
