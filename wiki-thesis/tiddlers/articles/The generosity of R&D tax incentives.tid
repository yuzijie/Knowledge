title: The generosity of R&D tax incentives
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Implied tax subsidy rates for R&D are influenced by business characteristics. ''Australia, Canada, France, Korea, the Netherlands and Portugal give more generous treatment to SMEs than to large firms.'' Some countries allow firms to benefit from tax incentives when they are not profitable enough to use them in the current period through refunds and carry-forward provisions, but few do so to a signifiant extent. ''In Austria and Norway, refunds by authorities effectively allow firms to benefit from incentives as if they were profitable. Such provisions tend to be more generous for SMEs and younger firms, as in Australia, France and the United Kingdom.''
