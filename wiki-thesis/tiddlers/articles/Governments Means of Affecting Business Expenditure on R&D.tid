title: Government’s Means of Affecting Business Expenditure on R&D
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There are a myriad of ways Governments influence the level of private R&D expenditure in an economy. These range from the more direct and commonly known methods such as <span class="yellow">grants and tax credits</span>, to the legal, regulatory and competitive environment fostered in a country through patent law; competition, tax, and immigration policy; and the efficiency of public administration. In addition, the ability of a country to supply highly educated staff through its higher education system is critical. The three most prominent methods, patent laws, grants and tax credits, are outlined below taking into account their efficacy as assessed by the empirical literature.

<span class="yellow">Patent law</span> increases the appropriability of private returns to R&D by offering legal protection to intellectual property. However, this approach has drawbacks as it inherently trades off public benefits for private. The limitations on the free use of new ideas inhibit both further research and the development of valuable commercial innovations which are a source of spillover benefits. Thus, although patent protections and similar rules maintain a prominent role in innovation policy (for example in the pharmaceutical industry), governments have also turned to direct support of R&D activities.
