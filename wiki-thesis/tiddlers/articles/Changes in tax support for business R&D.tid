title: Changes in tax support for business R&D
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Over 2006-11, the importance of tax incentives vis-à-vis direct support increased in 11 out of 23 countries for which complete data are available. Their share of support fell in many countries owing to the crisis-driven decline in business R&D. Mexico and New Zealand abolished their tax incentives but Finland introduced them in 2013. Falling profits at the outset of the economic crisis also reduced firms’ ability to claim incentives.
