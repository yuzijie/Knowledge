title: Patent law
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<span class="yellow">Patent law</span> increases the appropriability of private returns to R&D by offering legal protection to intellectual property. However, this approach has drawbacks as it inherently <span class="yellow">trades off public benefits for private</span>. The limitations on the free use of new ideas inhibit both further research and the development of valuable commercial innovations which are a source of spillover benefits. Thus, although patent protections and similar rules maintain a prominent role in innovation policy (for example in the pharmaceutical industry), governments have also turned to direct support of R&D activities.
