title: 6 A fuller picture: multi-faced schemes, sub-national tax incentives,  and innovation tax incentives.
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In fact, countries can use several different schemes at the same time. For instance Belgium offers a tax credit on R&D capital assets and fiscal incentives in the form of a reduction in taxes and social security contributions for R&D employees. The Netherlands, in addition to fiscal incentives on labour costs, also offers R&D tax allowances for self-employed workers spending at least 500 hours per year on R&D.

In addition to national R&D tax incentives (provided by central governments), some sub-national governments also provide their own R&D tax incentives that are usually combined with the national ones. For instance, in Canada, most provinces provide R&D tax credits for R&D performed in their provinces. Likewise, in the United States forty states currently have some type of R&D tax incentives, up from 35 in 1996 (Miller and Richard, 2010).

Some countries have introduced fiscal measures to stimulate innovation more broadly by @@.red-line extending the eligible base to expenses in advanced technology solutions@@ (such as "green" technology in Belgium) and acquisition of intangibles such as patents, licences, know-how and design (e.g. Spain, Poland). China also apply lower income taxes to high-technology enterprises and software development enterprises located in certain new technology zones. Finally, some countries also provide tax incentives on the outcomes of innovative activities by reducing the tax burden on income generated from patents (Belgium, Ireland) or income generated from all qualified R&D projects (the Netherlands).
