title: perfect appropriability
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Spence (1984) argues that perfect appropriability of R&D returns <span class="yellow">would result in redundant and hence excessive levels of R&D at the industry level</span>. Thus there is a theoretical trade-off between the positive incentives to the individual firm of appropriability on the one hand and cost efficiency with which the industry as a whole innovates, on the other. Spillovers therefore have been described as having a positive partial effect on industry’s costs and a negative effect on incentives. On the whole Spence argued that potential industry performance is significantly better with high spillovers (or low appropriability) because the output of R&D is essentially a public good and if it is implicitly priced as a private good, the performance of the system will be adversely affected.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
