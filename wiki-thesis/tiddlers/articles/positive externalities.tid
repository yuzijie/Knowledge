title: positive externalities
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The benefit to a private firm is lower than that available to society <span class="yellow">due to the inability of firms to fully capture all the benefits arising from R&D conducted internally.</span> This is due to the nature of R&D as a partially non-excludable good i.e. once an idea or innovation is introduced to the marketplace its use by other firms can no longer be restricted as effectively by the firm. The ability of firms to absorb and innovate using knowledge developed in other firms is a positive externality often described as a knowledge spillover.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>

It is due to the <span class="yellow">existence of the externality</span> that the Mirrlees Review<<footnote "note" "the Economic Approach to Tax Design in ‘Tax by Design’, the Mirrlees Review, Institute of Fiscal Studies, London, 2011.">> explicitly identified the R&D tax incentives as one of the few areas that Government’s should depart from the concept of neutrality in terms of the concept of optimum taxation.<<reference "[[Review of Ireland's research and development tax credit 2013]] - Chapter 4">>
