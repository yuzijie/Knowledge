A child tax credit is a [[Tax Credit]], which depends on ''the number of dependent children'' in a family.

In the United Kingdom, a family with children and an income below about Â£42,000 can claim child tax credit on top of child benefit. The tax credit is "non-wastable" - i.e. it is paid whether or not the family has a net tax liability - and is paid in or out of work. Higher rates are paid for disabled children. It is integrated with the working tax credit, which also provides support for childcare costs.
